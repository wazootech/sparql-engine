/**
 * JoinCostEstimator estimates the cost of joining one BGP triple pattern
 * against the current solution bindings. The estimate drives the greedy
 * join-order selection in BgpEvaluator.evaluateWithReordering — it must
 * never change results, only the order in which patterns are joined
 * (SPARQL 1.1 §18.2.2: joins commute, so every order yields the same
 * solution multiset).
 *
 * Contract: an estimator receives the pattern's ScanEntry — whose
 * candidates array holds the pattern's true store cardinality from the
 * up-front scan in evaluateWithReordering — plus the current bindings and
 * the pattern's statistics (planner piece 2, issue #129). Stats are
 * optional: they carry the store's per-variable distinct-value counts (see
 * PatternStats), and the estimator must degrade gracefully when absent (or
 * when a variable's distinct count is unknown). It may assume nothing else:
 * no store access. The estimator must be pure and deterministic: the same
 * entry, bindings, and stats always produce the same cost, and calling it
 * must have no side effects.

 * BaselineJoinCostEstimator is the default JoinCostEstimator: the greedy
 * formula the engine shipped before the estimator seam existed, extended to
 * use the piece-2 statistics when available. Bindings that bind no pattern
 * variable iterate every candidate quad; bindings that bind a pattern
 * variable probe the positional index, costing roughly the average bucket
 * size for the bound variable with the fewest distinct bound values.
 *
 * The average bucket is candidate count divided by that variable's distinct
 * count. The statistics source (PatternStatistics) supplies the store's
 * distinct-value count for the pattern's variables, which is the true bucket
 * average across the whole store; without stats (or for a variable the store
 * has no count for), the estimator falls back to the distinct count of the
 * values actually bound in the current bindings — the piece-1 behavior,
 * which adapts to the join's current state but overestimates when few
 * bindings remain. Either way the cost is a conservative per-binding bound.
