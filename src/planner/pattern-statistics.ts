 *     ScanEntry.candidates, which the join actually materializes;
 *   - distinctByVar — for each variable position of the pattern, how many
 *     distinct values that variable takes across the matched quads. This is
 *     the per-variable value-frequency that lets the estimator see true
 *     index bucket sizes, so two medium-selectivity patterns that share a
 *     variable are recognized as cheaper than unrelated patterns.
 *
 * Stats only ever influence join order — never results (SPARQL 1.1 §18.2.2).
